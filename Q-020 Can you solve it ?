Can you solve it ?Problem Statement:
Raman loves Mathematics a lot. One day his maths teacher gave him an interesting problem.

He was given an array 'A' consisting of 'n' integers, he was needed to find the maximum value of the following expression:

|Ai - Aj| + |i - j|

where, 0<= i,j

Input:
First line of input contains an integer T denoting number of test cases.
Each test case contains two lines, first line contains integer n where n is the number of elements in array
Second line contains n space separated integers Ai.

Output:
Print the maximum value of the above give expression, for each test case separated in a new line.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=n<=105
0<=Ai<=105

Time Limit:
1 sec

Example 1:
Input
2
3
1 1 1
4
1 2 3 1

Output
2
4

def find(arr, n):
    l1 = [v-i for i, v in enumerate(arr)]
    l2 = [v+i for i, v in enumerate(arr)]
    return max(max(l1) - min(l1), max(l2) - min(l2))
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
 
        print(find(l, n))
