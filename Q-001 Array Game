ArrayGameProblem Statement:
Adi and his brother Vabu are playing a game with arrays.

Vabu has an array A and Adi an array B of sizes N and M respectively. Since Vabu is the elder brother he wants every value of his array to be greater than or equal to the values of his brothers array.

In other words for every pair i ,j A[ i ]>=B[ j ]. In one operation he can increase or decrease any element of array A or array B by 1. Since he is always in a hurry he wants to perform this in minimum operations.

Can you help him in this simple task?

Input:
In first line you are given two integers N, M denoting the number of elements in array A and B respectively.

The next line contains N space separated integers of array A.

The last line contains M space separated integers of array B.

Output:
For every test case print the minimum number of operations.

Constraints:
00

Time Limit:
1 sec

#code

   int n,m;    cin>>n>>m;    ll a[n],b[m],ans=0;
   for(int i=0; i<n; i++) cin>>a[i];
   for(int i=0; i<m; i++) cin>>b[i];
   sort(a,a+n);
   sort(b,b+m);
   for(int i=0,j=m-1; i<n && j>=0; i++,j--){
       if(a[i]<b[j]){
           ans+=abs(a[i]-b[j]);
       }
   }
   cout<<ans;
    return 0;
}
