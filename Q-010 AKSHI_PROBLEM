AKSHI_PROBLEMProblem Statement:
In a maths quiz, Akshi is asked to solve a problem. She is given an array A of size N, she has to print the reverse of it.

Input:
First line contains an integer denoting the test cases 'T'. T test cases follow. Each test case contains two lines of input. First line contains N, the size of the array A. The second line contains the elements of the array.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, Akshi has to print the array in reverse order.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <=100
0 <= Ai <= 100


Time Limit:
1 sec
